A world food crisis is spreading as a result of Russia's blockade on Ukrainian grain, which is desperately needed in Africa and the Middle East. Food and fuel prices are spiralling across Europe too.\n\nEuropean economies and families are increasingly hard-hit.\n\nG7 face battle for unity as cost of war mounts\nPictures provide evidence of Russian grain theft\nBut Mr Johnson is also right. Now is the time that Western leaders and their allies must make a serious impact if they are to counter Russian aggression and its fair-weather ally China in any meaningful way.\n\nThe increasingly anxious and beleaguered voters of these G7 countries and their allies may find the joking around and posing for awkward photographs easier to accept - even welcome - if they result in concrete action."

Its mud homes appear to merge with the mountainside they're scattered on.\n\nIn Afghanistan's south-eastern Paktika province, less than 20 miles from the border with Pakistan, it's also about 20 miles from the epicentre of the earthquake which struck the region last week.\n\nA majority of its homes have been completely destroyed. And the structures still standing have deep cracks running through them, making them too dangerous to live in. It is home to 250 people, and because of its remote location no-one from the Taliban government or aid agencies have reached it with help so far. Before us, no journalists had been there either.\n\nAt the northern edge of the village, 20-year-old Arafat Gyankhail's house used to stand on a slope. Now it's a pile of rubble - stones, window frames and personal belongings lie amid the ruins.\n\n\"That night I heard a sound like a big explosion and something hit my head hard. I thought I was going to die. But I managed to crawl out from under the rubble,\" he said.\n\n\"I moved mud and stones aside and found my mother. When I touched her, I realised she was dead.\"\n\nTrauma is visible on Arafat's face. His mother Zartara was 50 years old. He told us she had swapped the spots they were sleeping in the night the earthquake struck.\n\n\"I miss her so much,\" he said.\n\nHis brother's wife and two children were also killed, as was a 12-year-old boy from another family. Dozens of people from the village have been injured.\n\nFour of Zapir Khan's grandsons are in hospital, one of them with a head injury. \"Everything we worked for and built has gone. We need help,\" he said.\n\n"
